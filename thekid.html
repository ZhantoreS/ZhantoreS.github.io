				<h2>The Kid. Review</h2> 
				<p>The Kid</p>
				<p>(1921)</p>
				<p>Directed by Charles Chaplin</p>
				<p>"The Kid" was Chaplin's debut in independent cinema. Having created the United Artists film studio, Chaplin and other independent authors set a course to create innovative cinema that did not pursue the patterns of genre comedy of the early twentieth century, and later became the foundation of the Golden Age of Hollywood.</p>
				<p>The "Kid" tape tells a very prosaic story about the loss of a child and the formation of a parent. The mother of the child is a poor, unhappy woman, or "The woman &mdash; whose sin was motherhood," for whom motherhood is an unaffordable burden. In the hope of providing her child with a prosperous existence, she leaves him in the cabin of an expensive car, which, unfortunately for her, is hijacked by bandits. Later, after discovering the child, they dump him in the slums between the garbage cans, where Charlie finds him. In several attempts to get rid of the child, he fails, and after finding a note asking him to love and protect the abandoned child, he decides to keep the baby for himself and calls him John. Five years pass, the viewer sees the daily routine of the impoverished, half-starved existence of Charlie and John, personifying the life of the lower social strata of American society of those years to which Chaplin himself belonged, which is why the picture becomes autobiographical. As in all Chaplin-directed films, the characters are not without difficulties and obstacles on the way to a quietly happy life of "little" people, whose burden is the ruthless capitalist system. Charlie and the baby will get into a miserable existence, interrupted by fraudulent hack jobs. But the baby gets sick, and this becomes the reason for his separation from his father. At the same time, the child's mother becomes a famous artist, she comforts herself with a dream about the return of her baby and his upbringing. Their destinies are unexpectedly intertwined, and the baby will get to his mother. At this time, Charlie, being desperate and discouraged, sees a dream in which he and his son fall into paradise, where a tragic biblical play unfolds: Charlie and the baby are dead and free from the burdens of being, they enjoy in the Garden of Eden, which is located in the same slums, but devils penetrate paradise and arrange a farce in which the tramp dies and returns to the human world. He is arrested and, surprisingly, brought not to the police station, but the mansion of the baby's mother. The end is happy, with a considerable share of drama and tragedy, which turns into a well-deserved conclusion for everyone.</p>
				<p>The film begins with the opening credits, followed by a prologue, "A picture with a smile &mdash; and perhaps, a tear". These words reflect the very essence of Chaplin's films: carelessly funny, with drama and sadness.</p>
				<p>Impulses of great humanism run like a red thread through all Chaplin's works. He is depicted in them comically funny, but he has a deeply tragic image and the fate of an ordinary person, which is why he becomes so familiar and close to everyone.</p>
				
				<p>In this and the previous review, I tried to reveal to you the spirit of Chaplin's films and make you want to get acquainted with them yourself. Thus, I will write entire collections of reviews dedicated to a single author, or a series of his films. The structural design of the issues will be easier to overlap than a random sequence of reviews of films by different authors and different eras. Literature may also appear.</p>
