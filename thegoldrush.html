				<h2>The Gold Rush. Review</h2>
				<p>The Gold Rush</p>
				<p>(1925)</p>
				<p>Director, screenwriter (although there was no script in the usual sense, Chaplin improvised during filming, built shots, scenes and controlled the work of the actors; he was an absolute perfectionist), composer, the main actor is Charlie Chaplin.</p>
				<p>At the end of the XIX century, the heyday of the gold rush in the USA, the tramp Charlie goes to Alaska in the hope of finding gold and at the same time instant wealth. Many other people with similar goals go to Alaska in search of quick and easily attainable wealth, despite the cold, hunger, and death threatening them.</p>
				<p>Charlie, having gone through great difficulties, unpredictably finds love, wealth, and friendship.</p>
				<p>The benevolence of fate and luck that accompanied Charlie led him to success, welfare, strong friendships, and love. Behind the top of the mountain, in the depths, there is an indomitable hope, goodness, and the inability to let go of your hands even in the most difficult situations. Despite loneliness, longing, hunger, and poverty, Chaplin draws the viewer's attention to socially acute and significant problems, but also faith in the best and optimism in his every move.</p>
